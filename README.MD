# My First Python Project
This is the first Python project on my road to re-teaching myself how to code after a loooong absence.

## Project Objective
This project is to read in a bunch of English text, whatever that may be, and then to create a list, ordered on the last letter of each word.

If there are many words with the same last letter, then the word will be placed in alphabetical order according to the penultimate letter, etc.

If the same word is encountered then a counter will be incremented for that word.

Lastly the list will be displayed on the screen in some way. This hasn't been decided yet, however it is likely to be to the console, and probably just a list, along with how many of each word there is if it is > 1.

## What to do next
At the moment this only adds based on the last letter. Should really sort alphabetically based on other letters if the same letter is found.
